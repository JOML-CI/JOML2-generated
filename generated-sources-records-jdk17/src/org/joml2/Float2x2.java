/**
 * Immutable 2x2 matrix of single-precision {@code float} components.
 * <p>
 * All operations leave the receiver unchanged and return their result as a value. An operation
 * whose result equals one of its operands may return that operand instead of allocating a new
 * instance.
 * <p>
 * Structural property bits: the matrix caches whether it is known to be the identity, a pure
 * translation, orthogonal (a proper rotation, with any translation) or affine, and the operations
 * dispatch to cheaper arms on those bits. The {@code make*} factories set the bits from what they
 * construct and the computing operations derive them from their operands' bits; the element
 * constructors and the {@code load*} factories recompute them with {@code determineProperties()},
 * which compares elements exactly against {@code 0} and {@code 1} and infers identity, translation
 * and affine only. A rotation loaded from a buffer or set from scalars is therefore merely affine -
 * never orthogonal - until it is rebuilt through a {@code make*} factory. The bits read this 2x2
 * matrix homogeneously, as a 1D transform whose last row is {@code (0, 1)} and whose {@code m01} is
 * the translation: a 2D rotation held in a 2x2 matrix gets no bits at all.
 * <p>
 * {@code equals} compares the components element-wise and bitwise, as by
 * {@code Float.floatToIntBits}: {@code 0.0} and {@code -0.0} are not equal, and NaN is equal to
 * NaN; the cached structural property bits are ignored, so two matrix objects holding the same
 * elements are equal whatever either one has determined about itself. {@code hashCode} is
 * consistent with it (derived from the same bit patterns).
 * <p>
 * {@code equalsEpsilon} compares per component with a tolerance: an infinite component never
 * compares equal, not even to an equal infinity (the difference {@code Inf - Inf} is NaN), and a
 * NaN component never compares equal to anything.
 *
 * @param m00 the element in row 0, column 0
