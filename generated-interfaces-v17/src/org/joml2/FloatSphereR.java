/**
 * Read-only view of a sphere of single-precision {@code float} components.
 * <p>
 * Declares the accessors, queries, store methods and dest-form operations that read but never
 * mutate the receiver; the mutable counterpart is {@link FloatSphere}. APIs that only read a sphere
 * should accept {@code FloatSphereR}, so callers can pass mutable instances without exposing them
 * to modification.
 * <p>
 * Arguments of type {@code FloatSphereR} must be instances created by the library ({@link Joml}
 * factories / the library's own types); the implementations read cached state through the library's
 * own classes, so foreign implementations of the {@code *R} interfaces are not supported as
 * arguments.
 * <p>
 * {@code equals} compares the components element-wise and bitwise, as by
 * {@code Float.floatToIntBits}: {@code 0.0} and {@code -0.0} are not equal, and NaN is equal to
 * NaN. {@code hashCode} is consistent with it (derived from the same bit patterns). Only instances
 * of this library's implementation compare equal to each other; the {@code equals} of a sphere
 * never returns {@code true} for an object of another type.
 * <p>
 * {@code equalsEpsilon} compares per component with a tolerance: an infinite component never
 * compares equal, not even to an equal infinity (the difference {@code Inf - Inf} is NaN), and a
 * NaN component never compares equal to anything.
