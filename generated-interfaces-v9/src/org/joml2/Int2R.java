/**
 * Read-only view of a 2D vector of {@code int} components.
 * <p>
 * Declares the accessors, queries, store methods and dest-form operations that read but never
 * mutate the receiver; the mutable counterpart is {@link Int2}. APIs that only read a 2D vector
 * should accept {@code Int2R}, so callers can pass mutable instances without exposing them to
 * modification.
 * <p>
 * Arguments of type {@code Int2R} must be instances created by the library ({@link Joml} factories
 * / the library's own types); the implementations read cached state through the library's own
 * classes, so foreign implementations of the {@code *R} interfaces are not supported as arguments.
 * <p>
 * {@code equals} compares the components element-wise with {@code ==}. {@code hashCode} is
 * consistent with it. Only instances of this library's implementation compare equal to each other;
 * the {@code equals} of a vector never returns {@code true} for an object of another type.
 * <p>
 * {@code equalsEpsilon} compares per component with an exact, non-negative integer tolerance: the
 * difference is widened to {@code long} before its magnitude is taken, so the two are compared
 * exactly without overflow, and a negative {@code epsilon} matches nothing.
