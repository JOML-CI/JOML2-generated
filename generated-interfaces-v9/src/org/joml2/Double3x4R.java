/**
 * Read-only view of a 3x4 matrix of double-precision {@code double} components.
 * <p>
 * Declares the accessors, queries, store methods and dest-form operations that read but never
 * mutate the receiver; the mutable counterpart is {@link Double3x4}. APIs that only read a 3x4
 * matrix should accept {@code Double3x4R}, so callers can pass mutable instances without exposing
 * them to modification.
 * <p>
 * Arguments of type {@code Double3x4R} must be instances created by the library ({@link Joml}
 * factories / the library's own types); the implementations read cached state through the library's
 * own classes, so foreign implementations of the {@code *R} interfaces are not supported as
 * arguments.
 * <p>
 * Structural property bits: the matrix caches whether it is known to be the identity, a pure
 * translation, orthogonal (a proper rotation, with any translation) or affine, and the operations
 * dispatch to cheaper arms on those bits. The {@code make*} factories set the bits from what they
 * construct and the computing operations derive them from their operands' bits; the element-wise
 * {@code set} methods and the {@code load*} methods recompute them with
 * {@code determineProperties()}, which compares elements exactly against {@code 0} and {@code 1}
 * and infers identity, translation and affine only. A rotation loaded from a buffer or set from
 * scalars is therefore merely affine - never orthogonal - until it is rebuilt through a
 * {@code make*} factory.
 * <p>
 * {@code equals} compares the components element-wise and bitwise, as by
 * {@code Double.doubleToLongBits}: {@code 0.0} and {@code -0.0} are not equal, and NaN is equal to
 * NaN; the cached structural property bits are ignored, so two matrix objects holding the same
 * elements are equal whatever either one has determined about itself. {@code hashCode} is
 * consistent with it (derived from the same bit patterns). Only instances of this library's
 * implementation compare equal to each other; the {@code equals} of a matrix never returns
 * {@code true} for an object of another type.
 * <p>
 * {@code equalsEpsilon} compares per component with a tolerance: an infinite component never
 * compares equal, not even to an equal infinity (the difference {@code Inf - Inf} is NaN), and a
 * NaN component never compares equal to anything.
