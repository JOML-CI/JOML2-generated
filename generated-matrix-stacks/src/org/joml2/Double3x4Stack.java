/**
 * Fixed-size {@link Double3x4} stack - port of JOML 1's
 * {@code Matrix*Stack} for emulating the legacy OpenGL push/pop matrix
 * stack ({@code glPushMatrix} / {@code glPopMatrix}).
 *
 * <p>The current/top matrix IS this object - all inherited
 * {@link Double3x4} operations apply to it directly. Calling
 * {@link #pushMatrix()} snapshots the current state into an internal
 * {@code Double3x4[]} array; {@link #popMatrix()} restores from it.</p>
 *
 * <p>This assumes the default in-place mode: with {@code joml.returnNew} enabled,
 * the inherited self-form operations return fresh instances instead of mutating
 * this stack top, which defeats the push/pop workflow.</p>
 *
 * <p>Only the top matrix takes part in {@code equals}, {@code hashCode} and
 * {@code set}: two stacks compare equal when their current matrices do, whatever
 * their depths and saved snapshots (a stack is also equal to a plain
 * {@link Double3x4} holding the same elements), {@code hashCode} hashes the top
 * alone, and {@code set(otherStack)} copies only the other stack's top matrix - its
 * saved snapshots and stack pointer are not copied.</p>
